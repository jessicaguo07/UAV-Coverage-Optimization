# UAV-Coverage-Optimization
This project explores the optimization of UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) coverage for dynamically moving users using deep Q-learning (DQL). The primary objective is to maximize the coverage area while ensuring efficient resource utilization in a predefined environment. Our approach leverages reinforcement learning to train UAVs to adapt to the movements of users within the environment.
